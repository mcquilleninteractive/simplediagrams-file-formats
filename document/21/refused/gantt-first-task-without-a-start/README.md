# Refused: Gantt chart whose first task has no start

**Rule broken:** The first task holds `start` or `after`. Here the first task, Research, holds neither.

**Stated in:** [complex-shapes/gantt/README.md](../../complex-shapes/gantt/README.md#rules), Rules.

**Caught by the JSON Schemas:** No.

**The app's message (English):** "The shape 7C9B4067-8797-59BB-B0A9-13916B3A54CA is not a valid complex shape."

## In this folder

`gantt-first-task-without-a-start.simplediagram/` is a complete document that breaks only this rule. It is stored without its empty `assets/` folder, because Git does not keep empty folders; a reader treats a missing empty `assets/` folder as empty.

## To make it valid

Give it a `start`, such as `2026-11-09`.
