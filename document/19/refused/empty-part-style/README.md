# Refused: empty part style

**Rule broken:** A part's `style`, when present, holds at least one channel. Here the section has `"style": {}`.

**Stated in:** [elements.md](../../elements.md#123-parts), Parts.

**Caught by the JSON Schemas:** Yes: `document.schema.json`.

**The app's message (English):** "The SimpleDiagrams document contains an invalid document.json file."

## In this folder

`empty-part-style.simplediagram/` is a complete document that breaks only this rule. It is stored without the empty `assets/` folder every document needs, because Git does not keep empty folders. Create an empty `assets/` folder inside it before opening it, or the document is refused for that instead.

## To make it valid

Remove `style`: a part without one follows the shape's paint.
