# Refused: newer shape of 257 parts

**Rule broken:** A complex shape has at most 256 parts, whatever its type. Here a shape of a type the reader does not know has 257.

**Stated in:** [elements.md](../../elements.md#121-the-structure), The structure.

**Caught by the JSON Schemas:** Yes: `document.schema.json`.

**The app's message (English):** "The SimpleDiagrams document contains an invalid document.json file."

## In this folder

`newer-shape-of-257-parts.simplediagram/` is a complete document that breaks only this rule. It is stored without the empty `assets/` folder every document needs, because Git does not keep empty folders. Create an empty `assets/` folder inside it before opening it, or the document is refused for that instead.

## To make it valid

Remove the last part.
